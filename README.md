# Crystal Radio Receiver
This project is a fully functional AM radio receiver that operates without any external power source. It captures radio waves from the air and converts them directly into audible sound using only passive components.

## Components
### 1. Antenna
- Long wire (several meters) to capture radio frequency (RF) signals
- Can be enhanced by connecting to metal objects

### 2. Tuning Coil (Inductor)
- Approximately 100 turns of magnet wire wrapped around a cardboard tube (toilet paper or paper towel roll)
- Wire ends sanded to expose bare copper for connections

### 3. Variable Capacitor
- **Stationary plate**: Aluminum foil wrapped smoothly around a paper towel roll
- **Moving plate**: Aluminum foil attached to paper that slides up and down around the roll
- Paper acts as insulator between the two foil plates
- Sliding the moving plate changes capacitance, allowing you to tune to different stations

### 4. Diode Detector
- Germanium diode
- Rectifies the AC radio signal to extract the audio information
- Mounted between metal paper fasteners on cardboard

### 5. Speaker
- Converts the detected electrical signal into audible sound

### 6. Ground Connection
- Wire connected to a ground point completes the circuit and improves reception quality

## How It Works
1. **Reception**: The antenna picks up electromagnetic radio waves broadcast by AM stations
2. **Tuning**: The inductor (coil) and variable capacitor form a resonant LC circuit that selects a specific frequency
3. **Detection**: The diode rectifies the high-frequency carrier wave, extracting the audio signal
4. **Output**: The earphone converts the electrical audio signal into sound waves you can hear
5. **Ground**: Provides a return path for the signal, essential for proper operation

## Notes
- No power source needed - the radio runs entirely on the energy from radio waves
- Reception varies greatly by location and time of day
- AM stations work best; FM stations won't work with this design
